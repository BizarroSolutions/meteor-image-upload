Image Upload
===============


Make sure you have GraphicsMagic installed.
On OS X: `brew install graphicsmagick`

This README is still a big TODO. In the meantime, check out the comments in the code here:

https://github.com/okgrow/meteor-image-upload/blob/master/lib/image_upload.js#L3

And examine the demo app available here: https://github.com/okgrow/meteor-image-upload-demo

For now, use the demo app as an example of how to set it up. It shows how to set up `allow`/`deny` rules for the image collections.
